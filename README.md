# Buglab uses the power of Ethereum to enable attainable, versatile, and reliable penetration testing for digital enterprise solutions.

## What is Buglab?
Buglab is a Ethereum-based platform that connects companies with a global network of expert cybersecurity researchers.
At the center of our ecosystem, there are two programs - the buglab contest and Vigilante Protocol, helping companies all over the world to discover and fix vulnerabilities on their digital solutions or assets.

## Contest
Buglab links clients with a global network of certified cybersecurity penetration testers in an incentivized environment. The testers are rewarded based on their cumulative discoveries in time-limit competitions.

Certified Pentesters
Full Customization
Real-Time Collaboration

## Vigilante Protocol
With this, buglab provides an avenue for whitehats to share their own vulnerability discoveries. We then work with CERTs all over the world to verify those discoveries and notify companies at risk.

CERT & CSIRT Partnership
Verified Reporting
Automatic Rewards for Whitehats

## What are BGL Tokens?
A token on the Ethereum blockchain is a digital asset that is held inside a token contract, in trust for a wallet address.
The buglab token, identified as BGL, is based on the ERC20 standard for blockchain tokens.
BGL tokens are required for all transactions in the buglab ecosystem, from ordering a contest to rewarding pentesters and whitehats.
