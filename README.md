# What are BGL Tokens?
A token on the Ethereum blockchain is a digital asset that is held inside a token contract, in trust for a wallet address.
The buglab token, identified as BGL, is based on the ERC20 standard for blockchain tokens.
BGL tokens are required for all transactions in the buglab ecosystem, from ordering a contest to rewarding pentesters and whitehats.
